• **Analyzing relationships between customer traits and purchasing behavior to uncover patterns and segment-specific tendencies.**

• **Enabling data-driven decision-making through an interactive Power BI dashboard that supports targeted marketing, personalized offerings, and improved customer engagement.**

## Key features
The dashboard addresses the following aspects:

✨ **Cluster-Based Segmentation:**
Applied Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) to segment customers into four distinct clusters—Stars, High Potential, Need Attention, and Leaky Bucket—based on normalized income, spending, and tenure metrics.

✨ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
Cleaned and transformed raw dataset using Power Query, handled missing values, corrected data types, and removed outliers to ensure accurate and reliable analysis.

✨ **Demographic & Behavioral Visualizations:**
Used stacked bar charts, donut charts, and column charts to showcase customer distribution by education level, marital status, number of children, and website visits, offering insights into personality traits across clusters.

✨ **Income & Spending Distribution Analysis:**
Visualized total and average income and spending across clusters using bar charts and histograms to highlight high-value customer segments.

✨ **Customer Tenure & Lifecycle Insight:**
Derived customer tenure (in months) using enrollment data and visualized it with line and column charts, enabling lifecycle and loyalty analysis by cluster.

✨ **Dynamic Filtering with Slicers:**
Enabled interactive slicers for Cluster, Education, Marital Status, and Date fields to allow real-time, user-driven exploration across the dashboard.

✨ **KPI Summary Cards:**
Showcased key metrics such as Total Income, Average Spending, Total Complaints, and more using reference-labeled KPI cards for at-a-glance insights.

✨ **DAX Measures & Calculated Columns:**
Created custom DAX measures and calculated columns to derive KPIs, customer tenure, and dynamic visual titles based on selected filters.

✨ **Detailed Data Tables with Drill-Through:**
Built interactive data tables with conditional formatting to display individual-level customer details and enabled drill-through capability for deep-dive exploration.

✨ **Bookmark-Based Navigation:**
Implemented Power BI Bookmarks for seamless transitions between pages such as Overview and Distribution, enhancing user experience and storytelling.

✨ **User-Friendly & Interactive Dashboard Design:**
Prioritized a clean layout, intuitive visuals, and responsive interactivity to ensure accessibility and usability for both business users and analysts.
